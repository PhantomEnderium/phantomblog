Been waiting a while for this, I'm engaged!!
<!--more-->
I've been with the love of my life Nicole for a little over 4 years now, and as of last Christmas Eve (yes, 2024!), we got engaged! We waited a little while to tell everyone being a little nervous about others opinions, but after we did (especially my parents) I thought "wow, we stressed for nothing".

It was a pretty spontanious thing, we've talked about it for a couple months, but woke up that morning and decided "let's go to the mall and get a ring!" We ended up walking into a Zales at our local mall, and, somehow, found just the perfect one for her. Had her birthstone in it, was the right size, everything. It was quite literally the PERFECT ring, and wasn't super expensive either, we bought it right away.

We got to the car and she was trying it on, I asked if it was something she needed to wait to wear until I proposed. Which after a little confusion, and a moreso of "fuck it who cares", I popped the question in the car. I don't think I've ever seen her so happy. We then immediately went and had Shake Shack for lunch, which that day tasted so damn good.

Do I wish it was a more formal and surprise of a proposal? Sure. Would I change the way it was done? Absolutey not. I love that girl and have no regrets on any of it.
