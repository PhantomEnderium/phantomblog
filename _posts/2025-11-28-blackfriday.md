Black Friday. Remember when people were rushing down stores the INSTANT they were open? Discounts of 90% or even more? The absolute worst brought out of people?? Now it's just "heyyyyy 50% off!" and most of it's online anyway. I used to get excited years ago and now it's not a huge thing, just "oh cool, this is a decent discount or bundled with something." I've seen crazier rushes for people trying to get Stanley Cups from Target or whatever.


Anyway, I got a Quest 3 finally! Didn't even go on sale, probably because it's permanently $150 off from its original price. Quest 3s, the more uh, "inferior" (less features) got a decent discount, as it's the newer and cheaper model to get more people on board. I wanted to try the one that's a little more fancy and went with the original 3. Confusing right? The older one is technically better.

Hard part with it is the charging. This thing DRAINS battery, and plugging it in doesn't help exactly. Official cable (which actually was on sale) sucks because it's USB-C to USB-C, and my computer conveniently has a not so good charging port. I returned it for a third-party "charging" one that has an extra port for plugging in a charge cable. The Quest however threw a fit and said there was "liquid in the charge port" so that's not really working. I have the charge part plugged into that USB-C on my computer and it helps but it still drains overall. Ah well, didn't go for the battery pack, but I get probably 3-4 hours of playtime which is totally enough for me without a headache.

Also trying to figure out good games to play. Population One is a battle royale game, but doesn't seem like anyone plays now. Rec Room is a personal favorite but the developers have been giving it little care. There's Beat Saber, which is pretty fun! I also found a demo called POOLS, which is a walking through of a backrooms pools environment, which was super unsettling but really cool. I'll have to look more for some others. I'm considering buying BONEWORKS or Blade and Sorcery, hear they're pretty good!
