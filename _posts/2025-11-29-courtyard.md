Being mindlessly bored at work, why not spin up another post?

I work at a Courtyard by Marriott hotel. Front Desk specifically. Out of all the jobs I've worked so far (and I've worked a decent amount since I was 16, so only 6 years thus far), this one has to be my favorite. I'm almost at a year of working and I don't feel like quitting, which is a great sign vs everything else!

Working a hotel front desk goes about how you would expect it. Check people in, check people out. Take phone calls for anyone calling the hotel. Make sure things are stocked in the market. That's pretty much it actually. Though there is a bit more to it. Marriott has only like 4 billions different softwares that get used, like checking on guest requests and other things. Our reservation system itself is called FOSSE, which some like to describe as "super old". Which to be fair it looks the same as it did from an image I saw going back 8-9 years ago. It's a more retro console application, so it's all keyboard controls, no mouse, no fancy graphics, just a terminal program. Which actually is pretty good, at least I think so. It runs on it's own server, so we don't actually run it on the front computers, but remote into it. The terminal can be customized with colors so you can make it look however you see fit, which is nice if you don't like the default blaring blue. Being a console program is also really nice, without said fancy graphics or whatever it runs REALLY fast. Knowing different menu button combinations, I can do certain actions from the main menu super quick. Need a printout of any particular report? Printer is going within 2 seconds. I love confusing my coworkers with how quick I do it.

Anyhow, I obviously can't give any insight into private work things. So I'll go into a topic of today at work: the lobby.

It's Christmas. It's all Christmas.

ALL FREAKING CHRISTMAS.

I worked Thanksgiving evening. Had off Black Friday. I come in today, and BAM. CHRISTMAS EVERYWHERE. Multiple christmas trees, lights, the WHOLE shebang. Marriott themselves aren't holding back either, my partner Nicole (who works overnight) said the minute 12am hit on Black Friday, the music switched to Christmas tracks. Our music is controlled by Marriott themselves, so they just set their hotel playlist to music the literal second Thanksgiving was over. And now I deal with this until, how long? December 26th? January 1st? Who knows?! I'm shocked they didn't start it earlier!

### Working Nights

Nights are pretty boring. Just checking people in and doing some side work that's needed. Otherwise I end up doing homework or something. I used to do morning shifts which were a lot more eventful but with doing college classes those get in the way. Semester is almost over though so hopefully I can go back to morning shifts, where I can be done by 3pm and go home with the rest of the day to myself!
